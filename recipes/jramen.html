    <h2>Ramen in  8 steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Separate the pork rib from the bone. Put the bone in a pot with water to boil. When it changes color, remove it and wash it with cold water.</li>
        <li>Place in a pot with water: the pork rib bone, the leek (reserve 1 of the leaves), 3 crushed garlic cloves, 3 slices of ginger, the onion and the carrot. Add salt. Boil 1 hour over low heat.</li>
        <li>Brown the pork rib (the boneless part) in a pan, on both sides. Once golden, add it to the pot and leave it for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Boil the 2 eggs in water with a splash of vinegar. Leave 6 minutes in totalâ€¦ no more than that! Cool and peel.</li>
        <li>Put the soy sauce, mirin, sugar and sake in a separate pot. Add the crushed garlic clove, the slice of ginger and the leek leaf that we had reserved. Cook over low heat and turn off when it boils.</li>
        <li>Marinate the pork and the whole and peeled eggs in this sauce. Minimum 1/2 hour.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta as directed on the package.</li>
        <li><p>Serve: place 3-4 tablespoons of the soy sauce from the marinade on the plate. 
            Add the portion of noodles in the center and broth of the soup until completing half the plate.</p> 
            <p>Put on one side the pork, cut into thin strips. In the other, an egg broken in half (the yolk should be almost runny). 
            Rain with the green onion cut very finely and in a chamfer. Why in chamfer? because it gives Japan, it is clear.</p> 
        </li>
